Virtual environment is an environment that you can set up for all of us to use, so we don't have to install package every time a new package is added to the code.
To use it, you need to first activate it
Its file is in backend

For windows,
  on your terminal, cd schedusmart-backend
  then do '.venv\Scripts\activate'

For mac, (I never try it, but it's from tutorial)
  cd schedusmart-backend
  source env/bin/activate

If everything works correctly, 
  in you terminal there should be something like (env) to illustrate you are using virtual enviroment
