Virtual environment is an environment that you can set up for all of us to use, so we don't have to install package every time a new package is added to the code.
To use it, you need to first activate it
Its file is in backend

For windows,
  it turns out that you will need to download the virtual environment by youself.
  Make sure you pull everything from git (the requirements.txt is fatal)
  To do so, first, remove everything in .venv file (make it empty)
  Then, 
    cd schedusmart-backend
    python -m venv .\.venv
    .\.venv\Script\activate
    .\.venv\Scripts\pip install -r .\requirments.txt
the install will takes a few while, but after install, try
pip list
If you see a bunch of things, then you are in the right track
Try run 
  flask --app server.py run 
to start up the backend.
If you see nothing, contact Stanley asap.

Boiler up!
